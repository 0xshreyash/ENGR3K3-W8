# ENGR3K3-Command-Line
Example program written to display to students how to use command line arguments in C.

The first command line argument is always the name of the program i.e. ./name

The second argument in this program is meant to be an integer. 

The third is the name of a file you are meant to read data from. 

If the code seems clear enough, try to extend th code to not just read data from input file, but also to take another
file as command line argument and write all the contents of the input file to the output file.
